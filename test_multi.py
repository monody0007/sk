Minimal multi-agent runner with hardcoded agent IDs.
Calls the improved single-agent test for each ID and prints latest replies.

This script demonstrates how to test multiple AI characters simultaneously
by running the single-agent test for each character in a predefined list.
It's useful for testing character consistency across multiple agents.
